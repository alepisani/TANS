vertex reconstruction code for a university project. (UNITO, TANS)

## how to run the code?
you should already have a build directory, for the sake we should firstly delete it. go in the main directory
```
rm -rf build/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./myprogram
```
you should see some kind of an output

still hardly work in progress!
